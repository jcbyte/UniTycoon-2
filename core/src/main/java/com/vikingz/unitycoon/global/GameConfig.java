/**
 * This class contains all of the config for the game,
 * things such as width, height, sounds volume etc.
 * This class is also used by the GameConfig Manager to save
 * the current config so that when the user reloads the game
 * their settings are still present.
 *
 * This is also a singleton class which means we instanciate it
 * once and then that instance can be fetched statically by calling
 * GameConfig.getInstance() and then from this instance we can retrieve
 * settings. We have chose to do this because by not making it static we
 * are able to implement Serializable which lets us save the GameConfig class
 * as is without any other logic.
